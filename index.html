        <h2><strong>Tsavo West National Park.</strong></h2>
        <p>Tsavo west national park is found along with the Kenyan coastal prince adjacent to the Indian ocean, it covers an area of 9,065 square kilometers. The A109 highway that runs from Nairobi to Mombasa together with the railway line that also runs from Nairobi to Mombasa cuts it away from Tsavo <strong>East National Park.</strong> Tsavo West National Park is the most famous destination in the two Tsavo Parks due to its easy accessibility from the coastal province of Kenya as well as the great scenic beauty of the park, rich with the variety of wildlife and the Ngulia rhino sanctuary, rocks and others.</p>
        <h2>The Ngulia Hills</h2>
        <p>30 km from Mzima Springs, along a well-marked track, is the <strong>Ngulia escarpment</strong>, (upon which stands Ngulia Lodge). Behind it rear the jagged peaks of the Ngulia Hills, a range of sheer cliffs that rise out of the plains, 610m below, to a height of 1825 m above sea level. Not only do the Ngulia hills offer magnificent vistas over the volcanic shoals of Tsavo but also, every year between late September and November, the adjacent <strong>Ngulia Bird-ringing Station</strong> plays host to one of the greatest avian spectacles in the world. In the 1960's Tsavo had the largest population of black rhinos in Africa (between 6,000 and 9,000) and they were a common sighted within the park. By 1981, however, Tsavo's rhino had been poached to the brink of extinction and only 100 animals remained. Today most of Tsavo's surviving rhino, plus numbers of re-located animals have been moved to the <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong>, close to the <strong>Ngulia Lodge</strong> where a meter-high electric fence surrounds an area of 70 sq km now designated an official sanctuary for approximately 40 rhinos. The Sanctuary also offers shelter to a broad range of other threatened wildlife to include cheetah and leopard and the rare frog (Afrixalus pygmaeus septentrionalis), which occurs only in the area between Mtito Andei and Voi. There are some good technical climbing routes around the Ngulia Hills, the most popular of which is Kichwa Tembo (the elephant's head). Some rewarding trekking can also be arranged. The Tsavo Park is ideally situated for visits to the massive expanses of sister park, Tsavo East whilst the verdant <strong>Taita Hills</strong> and the volcanic eruptions of the Chyulu Hills are close by. World-renowned <strong>Amboseli National Park</strong> is also within easy reach.</p>
        <h2>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary.</h2>
        <p>In 1940, there were an estimation 20,000 rhinos in <strong>Tsavo National Park,</strong> but by 1089, poaching decimated the rhinos and less than 20 individuals remained. The founding of <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> (NRS) and the Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) resulted in an increase in the rhino population, so much so that they have reached their carrying capacity in the <strong>Ngulia Rhino sanctuary</strong>. With Rhino Recovery Sanctuary funding, Tsavo trusts main focus is on growing the rhino numbers in the western part of <strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> through boosting security and monitoring outside the sanctuary in anticipation of rhino releases. To achieve this, the Tsavo West Intensive Protection Zone needs to be at level where Kenya Wildlife Service is confident to further populate the Intensive Protection Zone with the translocated rhinos from Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary, and this project will provide additional support to go there. The Ngulia Sanctuary is a home of rare Rhinos, the sanctuary was opened to protect the lives of the rare black rhinos in the park it is a stronghold a bleeding place for black rhinos in Tsavo and Kenya as a nation. The sanctuary has seen a rampant increase in rhinos from the time they were introduced. The Ngulia rhino sanctuary is one of the key attractions that are found in the Tsavo West National Park which makes your African safari experience complete and leaves you with memories. <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> is situated on the foothills of Ngulia hills covering an area of 80 square kilometers, this sanctuary is fenced with a 1 high electric fence and protected by the game rangers and the stuff, not only spotting the black rhinos in <strong>Ngulia National Reserve</strong> your able also to spot the rest of the animals within the sanctuary for example like the leopards and elephants. In the <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> the rhinos are mainly nocturnal and the chances of seeing one are slim black rhinos, apart from being understandably shy and more active at night, are browsers, not grazers and prefer to pass their time in the thick undergrowth. these archaic creatures are breeding successfully and around 15 have been released elsewhere in Tsavo West National Park. For all the security, one rhino was poached from inside the sanctuary in April 2014, with two more taken on 31 December 2016 amid reports of budget cuts and diminishing resources to fight poaching. Even so, there are plans to expand the boundaries of the sanctuary to the south. In <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> the 80 rhino individuals can easily be spotted during your visit in the sanctuary though the number of the rhinos in the sanctuary are more than 80 rhinos, and the sanctuary comprises of 5b waterholes and currently supports about 70 black rhinos, <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> offers very good chances of spotting the collusive black rhinos. <strong>Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary</strong> is surrounded by the mountains; on a brighter day the silhouette of Mount Kilimanjaro can be seen in the west. The ground is on most places covered with bushes, including the ones the black rhinos prefer to brows. They are many natural waterholes, but during the dry season, the rhinos get fresh water at one of four artificial waterholes, where fresh water is pumped and disturbed in pipelines. The borderline of the sanctuary consists of a fence with five wires, of which three are electrified, the purpose is not only to keep the rhinos inside, but also to keep the elephants and buffalos, competitors of the same food, outside the sanctuary. Other animals can easily pass, onto the other side of the fence, there is a road, both for patrolling by car but also provide a firebreak. There are number of stations inside the sanctuary where the rangers on duty are staying. The <strong>Ngulia</strong> headquarter is located outside the sanctuary, close to the main gate.</p>
        <h2>Kolmareden Wildlife Park.</h2>
        <p>Kolmarden is the test site and research laboratory. It is where the new technology and implement the research in a realistic environment. The wildlife park features the same four out of <strong>the big five</strong> as Ngulia (rhino, lion, elephant, buffalo, but not the hippo) The rhino density is much higher on the Kolmarden savannah, which is of course advantage for the test purposes. Kolmarden has many unique features as an outdoor research laboratory, with its large fenced enclosure, Information Communication Technology (internet through cable and Wifi,4G network), hotel with meeting facilities and among others. It is closed to visitors a large part of the year, and when there are no visitors, there are permission for visitors and came surveillance.</p>

        <h2><strong>Tsavo National Park </strong></h2>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> is made up of two separate parks, <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> and <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong>. The <strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> is located in Coast Province of Kenya in between Nairobi City and Mombasa.&nbsp;Extending over 21,812km2 (8421 square miles), both Tsavo East and West form the largest conservation area in Kenya, protecting significant populations of all the Big Five. Separated somewhat arbitrarily by the main road between Nairobi and Mombasa, the two parks are nevertheless quite different in character. Notoriously remembered as the scene of bloody massacre inflicted by the Hollywood-immortalized man-eating lions of Tsavo, it's hardly surprising that Kenya's largest wildlife preserve isn't the country's most popular destination. Occupying a whopping 3% of Kenya country's land area, Tsavo Park is comparable in size to Michigan, Jamaica, Wales, or Israel, and large enough to have been split into two separately managed parks -- <strong>Tsavo East</strong> and <strong>Tsavo West</strong> -- sadly divided up by the country's busiest highway, an ill-considered deathtrap for animals instinctively roaming between the unfenced reserves. With the constant roar of traffic chasing between Nairobi and Mombasa, were it not for the frequent scenes of roadkill that includes rarely spotted animals, you'd hardly suspect that each of the adjacent parks shelters an overwhelming abundance of wildlife including a third of Kenya's total elephant population -- just more than 11,000 of the beasts roam this ecosystem. If you have any say in the matter, ask your driver to slow down while driving between Nairobi and Mombasa. <strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> Notoriously remembered as the scene of bloody massacre inflicted by the Hollywood-immortalized man-eating lions of Tsavo, it's hardly surprising that Kenya's largest wildlife preserve isn't the country's most popular destination.

If you have any say in the matter, ask your driver to slow down while driving between Nairobi and Mombasa. Transformed into a wildlife preserve by pioneering warden David Sheldrick, the arid Tsavo was, until the 1940s, unchartered, completely undeveloped, and known simply as the Taru Desert. As with so many officially protected parks, Tsavo became a protected area because of its unsuitability for agriculture -- a tsetse fly infestation and lack of water kept this great swath of land from human exploitation. Previously, it served as hunting grounds for the Waliangulu and Kamba tribes, and it also saw some Anglo-German conflict during World War I. More recently, its outer extremities and northern reaches have been sites of bitter conflict between poachers and conservationists too ill equipped and understaffed to adequately police such a vast terrain. Nevertheless, authorities claim that they're winning the war on elephant and rhino poachers, and game numbers are on the increase. There are only two permanent rivers in this vast area. The Tsavo begins its life as snowmelt on Kilimanjaro and is greatly supplemented by a huge underground river flowing toward the famed <strong>Mzima Springs,</strong> a veritable oasis in Tsavo West. Meanwhile, the Athi River, in Tsavo East, begins near Nairobi. With the exception of small pockets of oasis like vegetation -- doum palms and Tana poplars that line the rivers and shelter the springs -- Tsavo's terrain can be extremely dry, dusty, and inhospitable, its miragelike plains broken by volcanic remnants and immense lava flows. Still, it's a landscape of unusual beauty and distinctive contrasts; the type of vegetation, in fact, varies so markedly that you'll notice distinct changes in the microclimate -- the temperature, even -- as you move around. One minute you might be watching hippos and crocodiles on a wide beach along the river, and the next observing the Tsavo's famous "red elephants" stomping in the dust. And with so much space in which to maneuver, it's not much of a challenge to steer clear of fellow visitors.

            <h2><strong>Tsavo National Park by Road </strong></h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Thanks to the Mombasa-Nairobi highway and its proximity to the coast, many people visiting Tsavo do so as a sidebar to seaside holidays. By road, Tsavo East is 3 1/2 hours from Mombasa and 4 1/2 hours from Nairobi -- of course, traffic can be scary if you have no control over the speed at which your driver decides to tear along the highway. Coming from Nairobi, Tsavo East is accessed via the town of Voi (where KWS has its headquarters) through either of two gates: Voi or Manyani. From Mombasa, entry is via Bachuma Gate, whereas if you're on the road from Malindi, you'll arrive via Sala Gate. Such details aren't likely to affect you, though, as your driver and ground operator will conspire to make sure you get there in the quickest possible time -- in fact, better to request a more modestly paced drive, if you can. For <strong>Tsavo West,</strong> the main access points are Chyulu Gate, if coming from Amboseli, or Mtito Andei Gate if approaching via the highway from either Nairobi (240km/149 miles) or Mombasa. Visitors from Mombasa also use Tsavo Gate near Manyani.

            <h1>Tsavo National Park by Air</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Tsavo is close to both the Malindi and /Mombasa coast and the Chyulu Hills, which by private charter takes approximately 35 minutes.

            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="text-justify">A 50-minute flight will get you from Nairobi to Tsavo West; <strong>Safarilink</strong> has daily flights departing the capital at 7:30am. Note that the return flight takes 70 to 80 minutes. <strong>Mombasa Air Safari</strong> flies from the coast to the private airstrip at Finch Hattons in Tsavo West. There are no scheduled flights to Tsavo East, but 6 airstrips in the southern part of the park and 13 in the northern part are available for charter flights -- your ground operator will make arrangements for you to be dropped at the one nearest your lodge or camp, and land transfers will be organized, too.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Tsavo Park Fees or conservation fees</strong></h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Entry to either park is $50 per day for adults and $25 for children ages 3 to 18; if you want to see both parks in a single day (although, given the enormity of each of them, you should have no reason to do this), you will need to pay twice. Access to either park is by means of a KWS Smartcard, which your ground operator can purchase and load for you in advance of your arrival; don't arrive without a prepaid card, as this will mean making a time-consuming detour to park headquarters to pick up a new card.
