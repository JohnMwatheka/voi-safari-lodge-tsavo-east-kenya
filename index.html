        <h1>Tsavo East National Park</h1>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> is by far the biggest of Kenya&rsquo;s parks. At more than 13,700km&sup2;, Tsavo East is nine times bigger than the Maasai Mara National Reserve: indeed, you could fit the whole of the Mara reserve into the southern tip of <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong>, south of the Voi River. Tsavo East has another big draw: you can set off on a game drive across the seemingly empty wilderness and return to camp three hours later without having seen a single other vehicle. There are very few camps and lodges here and, relatively speaking, almost none, with the majority of them close to Voi in the west, near the Mombasa highway. You often have the park to yourself, watching the wildlife under a huge sky: no matter what you&rsquo;re looking at, Tsavo East always feels like a big spectacle. When considering a <strong>Tsavo East safari</strong>, it's worth knowing that nearly all safaris take place in the south of the park, south of the Galana River. The enormous northern region of Tsavo East was closed to the public for many years and, although it is now open again, distances are vast up here and there is virtually no infrastructure. In practice, it's an area for adventurous explorers, not game drives. Incidentally, although Tsavo East and Tsavo West share a name &ndash; and a common border, coinciding with the Mombasa highway &ndash; they are two distinct national parks with different eco-systems: the wooded and hilly landscapes, dotted with volcanic cones and dramatic, black lava flows of <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> and the much flatter, more open plains and scattered bush that characterize <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong>. Tsavo East National Park, though, holds its own esteemed credits and is known as one of the greatest biodiversity sites in the world. With easy access to the park from the coast of Mombasa, <strong>Voi safari lodge</strong> guests travel across immense savannah plains that are dotted with thorn bushes, stands of acacia trees, scrublands and woodlands. The rolling topography lulls you into a dream-like state as you uncover the varied ecological and historical treasures. The massive Yatta Plateau emerges from the horizon, and before you know it, you are sitting at the very site where molten rock from Ol Doinyo Sabuk Mountain had formed one of the longest lava flows on earth. The rocky outcrop known as &ldquo;Mudanda Rock&rdquo; is another breathtaking geological structure that extends 1.6 kilometers along the plains. At the base of the immense rock is a watering hole where you catch your first glimpse of animals drinking.&nbsp; The Athi River weaves its way along the landscape lined with doum palms. As you follow the meandering river, you arrive at Lugards Falls where the water is squeezed through narrow openings in strangely eroded rocks. The change in pressure creates a wonderful series of rapids that eventually end in pools where crocodiles await a tasty meal from an unsuspecting thirst antelope. This is where the river meets the adjoining tributary from the Tsavo River to form the Galana River that runs all through the park and all the way to the coast of Watamu as the renewed Sabaki River. You may also see man-made structures that tell the story of human history, including railway travel, exploration and wartime battles. Tsavo East also has the seasonal Voi River, which originates from the highlands of Taita Hills, running along the park where it partly drains at Aruba Dam and the remaining drains all the way to the Gedi, near Watamu. Some of Kenya&rsquo;s largest elephant herds are in Tsavo East Park, so you will likely see these grey-skinned animals in several locations. What you may not expect, though, is the color of their skin being partly red. These elephants&rsquo; dust themselves with the red-brown Tsavo murram soil, so photographing them creates evocative images that are the envy of many visitors. Prides of mane-less lions, some sharing the DNA from the man-eater lions of Tsavo along with herds of buffalos are also been frequently seen in the park. Dispersed amongst these animals are giraffes, zebras, lesser kudus, coke&rsquo;s hartebeests, grant&rsquo;s gazelles, klipspringers, impalas, waterbucks, gerenuks, hunter&rsquo;s hartebeests and many more sought-after fauna. In the rivers, you may see hippos enjoying the refreshing water that cools them throughout the day. Bird lovers find a paradise of resident and migratory species as more than 500 species have been recorded in Tsavo East. You are sure to have a discerning Kenya birding tour of a lifetime should you sight the kestrels and buzzards that respite in the park during their migrations.

            <h2>When to Visit Tsavo East Park</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Your time in <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> promises to be an unforgettable wilderness holiday in Kenya. Relish in some of Africa&rsquo;s finest wildlife viewing and safari experiences while enjoying the warm temperatures. Daytime temperatures in the park range from 80 F (27 C) to 90 F (32 C) depending on your month of travel. The months with the coolest daytime temperatures are June through August, and January to March have the warmest daytime temperatures. Night-time low temperatures range from 60 F (16 C) to 68 (20 C) dependent on the seasonal months. We do advise our guests, though, that droughts are more common in Tsavo East than in the bordering park of <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong>. Historically, droughts have been so severe that the 85-hectare reservoir at Aruba Dam has dried up completely. This results to wildlife congregating at more permanent water sources like the Galana River. While these climatic conditions make <strong>Tsavo East Park a superb African bush safari destination</strong> any time of year, you should also consider the effects of the dry and rainy seasons. The presence or absence of rain affects not only the vegetation, but also wildlife behavior, room rates and logistics. We primarily recommend the long dry season from July to October to most of visitants to Tsavo, especially if you are new to bush travel in Kenya. 

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mb-3">
            
            <p class="text-justify"> Without adequate precipitation, plants and grasses are sparse at best, and seasonal watering holes are dry. In the search for food and water, wildlife relocates to more permanent water sources where they also find adequate water and surrounding nourishment.&nbsp; As a result, the animals are found gathered in small areas. The minimal vegetation and diverse groups of animals affords you to view numerous species in a central area, especially herbivores, much more easily than when dispersed wildlife have more options for eating and drinking. These prime conditions draw many guests, both locally and internationally. The long dry season also coincides with migration in Masai Mara and also the summer holidays for American and European families, so you will experience the highest guest levels at the park during the long dry season, especially from the coastal resorts of Mombasa, Malindi, Watamu and Kilifi. Guest levels decrease slightly during the short rainy season in November and December, and some accommodations lower their room rates. The only exceptions are Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s. Other prices, though, are constant regardless of the season, such as meals, park entry fees, logistics, and activities, to name only some of the costs that are associated with your exploratory travel in East Africa. Rainfall during the short-wet season in Tsavo compared to other parts of Kenya is not similar. There is more precipitation in comparison. This is primarily due to location of the park being so close to the coast of Kenya. In January and February, a short hot, dry season arrives, followed by the wettest time of year &ndash; the long rains from March through May and parts of June. The precipitation is significant, and rain may fall continuously for several days but not throughout the day. Roads and trails are muddy because of the increased moisture. Your safari activities may be impacted due to the difficulty of navigating the park by vehicle and on foot. For those spirited guests who desire a <strong>magical Kenya trip in Tsavo East with us</strong>, the long rains bring renewed life in both flora and fauna. The landscape is transformed as plants, flowers, trees and bushes spring to life, and you may see first-hand the first few minutes of a newborn mammal&rsquo;s life. Birding is also best during this time, especially with avian-life migrating from the cold European habitats.

        <h2><strong>Tsavo National Park </strong></h2>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> is made up of two separate parks, <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> and <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong>. The <strong>Tsavo National Park</strong> is located in Coast Province of Kenya in between <strong>Nairobi City </strong>and<strong> Mombasa</strong>.&nbsp;Extending over 21,812km2 (8421 square miles), both Tsavo East and West form the largest conservation area in Kenya, protecting significant populations of all the Big Five. Separated somewhat arbitrarily by the main road between Nairobi and Mombasa, the two parks are nevertheless quite different in character. Notoriously remembered as the scene of bloody massacre inflicted by the Hollywood-immortalized man-eating lions of Tsavo, it's hardly surprising that Kenya's largest wildlife preserve isn't the country's most popular safari destination. Occupying a whopping 3% of Kenya country's land area, Tsavo Park is comparable in size to Michigan, Jamaica, Wales, or Israel, and large enough to have been split into two separately managed parks -- <strong>Tsavo East </strong>and<strong> Tsavo West</strong> -- sadly divided up by the country's busiest highway, an ill-considered deathtrap for animals instinctively roaming between the unfenced reserves. With the constant roar of traffic chasing between Nairobi and Mombasa, were it not for the frequent scenes of roadkill that includes rarely spotted animals, you'd hardly suspect that each of the adjacent parks shelters an overwhelming abundance of wildlife including a third of Kenya's total elephant population -- just more than 11,000 of the beasts roam this ecosystem. If you have any say in the matter, ask your driver to slow down while driving between Nairobi and Mombasa. Tsavo National Park Notoriously remembered as the scene of bloody massacre inflicted by the Hollywood-immortalized man-eating lions of Tsavo, it's hardly surprising that Kenya's largest wildlife preserve isn't the country's most popular destination. Occupying a whopping 3% of the country's land area, Tsavo is comparable in size to Michigan, Jamaica, Wales, or Israel, and large enough to have been split into two separately managed parks -- Tsavo East and Tsavo West -- sadly divided up by the country's busiest highway, an ill-considered deathtrap for animals instinctively roaming between the unfenced reserves.

If you have any say in the matter, ask your driver to slow down while driving between Nairobi and Mombasa. Transformed into a wildlife preserve by pioneering warden David Sheldrick, the arid Tsavo was, until the 1940s, unchartered, completely undeveloped, and known simply as the Taru Desert. As with so many officially protected parks, Tsavo became a protected area because of its unsuitability for agriculture -- a tsetse fly infestation and lack of water kept this great swath of land from human exploitation. Previously, it served as hunting grounds for the Waliangulu and Kamba tribes, and it also saw some Anglo-German conflict during World War I. More recently, its outer extremities and northern reaches have been sites of bitter conflict between poachers and conservationists too ill equipped and understaffed to adequately police such a vast terrain. Nevertheless, authorities claim that they're winning the war on elephant and rhino poachers, and game numbers are on the increase. There are only two permanent rivers in this vast area. The Tsavo begins its life as snowmelt on Kilimanjaro and is greatly supplemented by a huge underground river flowing toward the famed <strong>Mzima Springs,</strong> a veritable oasis in Tsavo West. Meanwhile, the Athi River, in Tsavo East, begins near Nairobi. With the exception of small pockets of oasis like vegetation -- doum palms and Tana poplars that line the rivers and shelter the springs -- Tsavo's terrain can be extremely dry, dusty, and inhospitable, its miragelike plains broken by volcanic remnants and immense lava flows. Still, it's a landscape of unusual beauty and distinctive contrasts; the type of vegetation, in fact, varies so markedly that you'll notice distinct changes in the microclimate -- the temperature, even -- as you move around. One minute you might be watching hippos and crocodiles on a wide beach along the river, and the next observing the Tsavo's famous "red elephants" stomping in the dust. And with so much space in which to maneuver, it's not much of a challenge to steer clear of fellow visitors.

            <h2><strong>Tsavo National Park by Road </strong></h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Thanks to the Mombasa-Nairobi highway and its proximity to the coast, many people visiting Tsavo do so as a sidebar to seaside holidays. By road, Tsavo East is 3 1/2 hours from Mombasa and 4 1/2 hours from Nairobi -- of course, traffic can be scary if you have no control over the speed at which your driver decides to tear along the highway. Coming from Nairobi, Tsavo East is accessed via the town of Voi (where KWS has its headquarters) through either of two gates: Voi or Manyani. From Mombasa, entry is via Bachuma Gate, whereas if you're on the road from Malindi, you'll arrive via Sala Gate. Such details aren't likely to affect you, though, as your driver and ground operator will conspire to make sure you get there in the quickest possible time -- in fact, better to request a more modestly paced drive, if you can. For <strong>Tsavo West,</strong> the main access points are Chyulu Gate, if coming from Amboseli, or Mtito Andei Gate if approaching via the highway from either Nairobi (240km/149 miles) or Mombasa. Visitors from Mombasa also use Tsavo Gate near Manyani.
            </p>
            <h1>Tsavo National Park by Air</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Tsavo is close to both the Malindi and /Mombasa coast and the Chyulu Hills, which by private charter takes approximately 35 minutes. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="text-justify">A 50-minute flight will get you from Nairobi to Tsavo West; <strong>Safarilink</strong> has daily flights departing the capital at 7:30am. Note that the return flight takes 70 to 80 minutes. <strong>Mombasa Air Safari</strong> flies from the coast to the private airstrip at Finch Hattons in Tsavo West. There are no scheduled flights to Tsavo East, but 6 airstrips in the southern part of the park and 13 in the northern part are available for charter flights -- your ground operator will make arrangements for you to be dropped at the one nearest your lodge or camp, and land transfers will be organized, too.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Tsavo Park Fees or conservation fees</strong></h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Entry to either park is $50 per day for adults and $25 for children ages 3 to 18; if you want to see both parks in a single day (although, given the enormity of each of them, you should have no reason to do this), you will need to pay twice. Access to either park is by means of a KWS Smartcard, which your ground operator can purchase and load for you in advance of your arrival; don't arrive without a prepaid card, as this will mean making a time-consuming detour to park headquarters to pick up a new card.
